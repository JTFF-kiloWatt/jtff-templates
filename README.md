# JTFF mission templates script utilities

This set of scripts help handle the JTFF mission templates
It provides functional scripts to handle all kind of support in your missions like

* Airboss
* AWACS
* Airborne Tankers
* Ground practice ranges
* Air to air practice ranges
* etc...

All aspects of mission that it can handle is described in the powerpoint document here :
https://github.com/JTFF-mission-scripts/jtff-templates/blob/develop/docs/jtff-templates-manual.pdf

It's still a highly WIP but it may help you get onboard with mission scripting JTFF-style...

## Credits
If you use our scripts for your missions, well, THANK YOU for your trust but **please be kind and give JTFF a little credit in your mission briefing to reward us on our work**
If you notice any bug in our scripts or if you want to improve the scripts, please consider joining the contributor team, I would be more than happy to have extra help.

# Scripts provided

## cleanup
You can cleanup all the build folder to get back on your feet if you get lost.

```
npm run clean
```

## build template missions
To generate template missions for JTFF based on the scripts provided in this repo you can run :
```
npm run build
```
It will provide in the **./build** folder all the JTFF-templates for all the theatres described in the **./config.json file**.

You can of course edit this config.json file to modify the theatres you want to generate a template mission.

## inject JTFF scripts in a new mission
You can also use the JTFF-scripts in your own missions. If you want to inject some scripts in the mission you juste created, you can run the script **inject-scripts.cmd**

It will prompt you for the miz file you want to inject the JTFF scripts into and also ask you which scripts you want to inject :
